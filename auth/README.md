# Authentication

## Ory backend

### Oathkeeper
proxy to protect apis, works with nginx auth_request

### Kratos
User and identity management
[Quickstart guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/quickstart). Build from there

## Frontend
Kratos has no build in frontend UI. This is something we will have to implement.
